1)Created database in sqlite3 in python coz it will be almost same as postgre(just connecting method will be different)
2)Created solution by using list data type(for ease of work) and one of the team member share the part of solution by which we can pull rows randomly from table in database, and also search for if any other different logic available.
3)There was very slight chance of rows to be repeated, so for that I extended code to avoid that, whose logic will be based of id of each question.Thus remove the worry of repeatation of questions
4)Tested and analyzed the code using different test cases

1)Create a database by using python module sqlite3 called "question.db" which consist a table "result" which have 4 columns("question","option 1", "option 2","ans").
2)Then using different SQL command insert the values of the column after display the table value which is persent in the database. Then wrote the logic to print random question from database without repetation of any question.

1)did some  research on  how we can connect the database from backend and how to display random question from database . 
2) Created database in postgres sql for questions, options and ans. 
3) Connected database to the  backend. 
4)created query to print the random question from database . 
5) discussed with the whole group about our program and checked the all the test cases whether the question repeating or not.

1)Installed postgreSQL on my system. 
2)Created table named as question in database test by using postgreSQL.
3)Developed a Python program  which randomly select and display questions from database with the help of  random () function. 
4) Created 7 columns (Question No., Question, Option1, Option 2 , Option3, Option4, Answer) in Question table. Then with the help of for loop I have displayed fixed number of questions. I have used fetchall function to fetch query result from database.

1)Created a ER diagram of question and answer table  
2)created a Sequence diagram for better understanding of our problem statement .
3)Created database of question and answer table. In this create a random 20 questions and their answers columns. In question table create a four columns (id, questions, correct answer and status ) In status column (YES/NO) Shows whether the question asked previously or not.- NO status indicates  question is not repeated . - YES status indicates question is repeated.  - Database connection from python to database

1)First researched about the problem statement and ways through which the Problem Statement can be solved. 
2)Created a Database containing question & answer table and python program to randomly select questions from the database and display them.

1)first  I discussed the topic  with my group members for  better understanding of our problem statement .
2)Created database of question and answer table. For this problem i created a random 10 questions and their answers columns.
3)In question table I created a four columns (id, questions, correct answer and status ) In status column (YES/NO) Shows whether the question asked previously or not.- NO status indicates  question is not repeated . - YES status indicates question is repeated.
4)Database connection from python to database.

1)Researched and Drawn some ER diagram about the problem statement for better understanding.
2)Created a database by using python sqlite3 named "random_questions.db" which consists of question and  answer table which contains multiple columns of exam questions,answer and their options.
3)Then using different SQL command insert the values in the columns and display the table value which is present in the database.
4)Then build the logic of the program that would print random questions from the database and display them.

1)I first tried to gain more knowledge on the problem statement by learning the basics and then slightly started with the more complicated part.
2)Then i created a database with question,answer and user table.
3)Then wrote a python program which would enable me to create a  program that would fetch questions randomly from the database and display them


Everyone in team discussed & used their own logic and came up with their different or same solution.In the end we chose one efficient & perfect code to push on gitHub repositary
